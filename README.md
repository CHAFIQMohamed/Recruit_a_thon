# Recruit_a_thon
CareerConnect is a web application that acts as a mediator between companies and job seekers. Companies or employers can notify about the employment opportunities by posting them on the portal. This app has two categories: primary and premium. The primary category is for interns and freshers having minimal skill-set and industry experience. The premium category demands candidates having experience. Employers need to pay a fee in order to post about job opportunities in the premium category. The app helps recruiters to select candidates having appropriate talent by shortlisting them on the basis of their skills which match the job profile. Then only a few rounds of interviews of the shortlisted candidates are enough to make the right choice, thus making the entire recruitment process much simpler and less time consuming.
